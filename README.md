I'm glad I took the TypeScript pill, automatically generating intellisense from JSON responses using interfaces would've saved me a lot of needless back and forth querying.

Compared to the dumpster fire of my first TypeScript + React project, this went a lot better, probably because I wasn't diagnosing issues for 2 technlogies at once... Also worth noting that generating interfaces for JSON responses comes from an extension, and me not knowing about it before turned VScode into a sea of red when trying to fetch anything with TypeScript.
